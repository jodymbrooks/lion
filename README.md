# Brave - the card game
Brave is a simple card gam


## Ideas
 - [ ] Use icons for the matching attrs instead of words to make that shorter
 - [ ] Create a computer player
 - [ ] Allow for a one-deal game (or some other way to make it go more quickly)
 - [ ] Add an intro/help screen
 - [ ] Keep high scores
 - [ ] Prompt for player names
 - [ ] Allow for more than two players

## Bugs
 - [ ] Once the cards remaining goes to 0, either the next deal or the one after that will replenish the cards back up to a full deck
 - [ ] The shuffling still doesn't seem random enough but no matter how many times I shuffle the deck, it's always about the same... the test is that **most** of the time, I can pick two cards side by side and they'll match as a two-some.  If not, then usually one of the cards beside those two will match one of those. This happens way too often for the shuffling to seem random. Need to check play with a real deck and see if this happens there too. It may just simply be due to the statistics of the available attributes, etc.
