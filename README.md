L.I.O.N. Like It Or Not!

A fun game of finding trios of cards that have attributes that are "Like It Or Not!" (L.I.O.N.)

The deck consists of 81 cards where each card has four attributes each with three possible values. These are:

| color  |   shape   | count | pattern |
| :----: | :-------: | :---: | :-----: |
|  red   |  ellipse  |  one  |  empty  |
| green  | rectangle |  two  | filled  |
| purple |  diamond  | three |  lined  |

A table of 12 cards is dealt (3 x 4) face down.

Play continues until no more matches may be made and no more cards are left to deal. Note that at some point, the remaining deck will be empty but there will still be cards on the table to play. Play continues still at this point.

At the end, the player with the most trios wins.

This game idea came from another game a friend showed me. I think it was called Sets so if you want a similar paper-card version, find that game and buy it. Thus the idea of the game is not mine (therefore I don't mind saying how fun it is because I get no credit from it. -- It really is nearly addictive!). I've only made an electronic version and added scoring.

The point of L.I.O.N. is to make "trios." A trio is a set of three cards that have attributes that are "Like It Or Not." What does that mean? Well, it's pretty simple to see, a little harder to explain, but it's a lot of fun so it's worth trying to figure it out. Let me try to explain first and then show some examples below.

Every card has 4 attributes:

the type of shape -- either rectangle, ellipse or diamond

the number of shapes -- either 1, 2 or 3 shapes on a card

the color of the shapes -- either red, green or purple -- all shapes on a card are the same color

the fill pattern of the shapes -- either solid, empty or with vertical lines (I'll call it "fenced") -- all shapes on a card have the same fill pattern

So for each attribute, all cards have to have exactly the same value or all different. The type of shapes have to be all the same or all different in the 3 cards you choose. The number of shapes has to be all the same or all different. The color has to be all the same or all different. And the fill pattern has to be all the same or all different.

So say for instance you choose the following 3 cards:

This would be a trio because of the following:

the type of shape -- all have same shape, ellipses

the number of shapes -- all have same number, 1

the color of the shapes -- all have same color, purple

the fill pattern of the shapes -- all have different fill patterns, solid, empty and fenced

However, this next very similar example is not a trio because of the types of shapes.

They are not all the same and they are not all different (2 are ellipses). So you see that if only 2 cards share any attribute with the 3rd card being different for that attribute, then it can't be a trio.

As it turns out, there will always have to be at least one of the attributes that are all different as there are only 81 cards (you math guys can figure out why it's 81 if you want to) so no two cards in the deck are exactly alike. Therefore you can never have 3 cards exactly alike, so again a proper trio will always have at least one of the attributes be completely different for the 3 cards. In fact it's often the greatest challenge to me to look for trios where all four attributes are all completely different, like this example.

As you can see the shapes are all different, the number of shapes is all different, the colors are all different and the fill patterns are all different. This is a good trio.

As for the other aspects of the game, here are just a few notes.

Game Level You choose your game level at the beginning of each game. This doesn't really affect how hard or easy the game is, but does affect the scoring. For example, at the Cub level (beginner), hints don't cost as much against your score and you have longer time in which to make trio and still be able to get a bonus for it.

Scoring The scoring involves a number of factors. Here are some notes on the factors involved in scoring as well as a little more info on the differences the selected game level introduces. I'm not completely sure all the scoring works exactly as detailed below. If you find a particular place where you know it doesn't, please let me know.

Cub (Beginner)

trios worth 200 points

bonus 1/2 trio's points if trio made in 15 seconds

only charged for 3-card hints: 1/2 trio's points

no cost for time

no cost for incorrect trios

Leo (Intermediate)

trios worth 250 points

bonus 1/2 trio's points if trio made in 10 seconds

only charged for 2-card and 3-card hints: 1/2 trio's points

time cost 60 pts every 60 seconds

no cost for incorrect trios

King of the Jungle (Advanced)

trio worth 300 points

bonus 1/2 trio's points if trio made in 5 seconds

charged for all hints: 1/2 trio's points

time cost 60 pts every 30 seconds

incorrect trios cost 1/3 trio's points

Other

You can turn the animations off if they bother you or slow you down.

When you pause a game, the timer is stopped and the board is hidden -- not that we think you'd cheat! :)

You can get one-card, two-card, or three-card hints based on how you set the Options. However, if you choose less than three-card hints, you are still asked if you want to see the next card of the hint. Remember though that hints do eventually cost you score points.

- [ ] Create a computer player
- [ ] Allow for a one-deal game (or some other way to make it go more quickly)
- [ ] Add an intro/help screen
- [ ] Keep high scores
- [ ] Prompt for player names
- [ ] Allow for more than two players
